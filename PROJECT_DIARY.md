## Phase 8: Dataset Preparation Script Consolidation - November 2025

### Motivation

Project accumulated multiple dataset preparation scripts over development phases:

- `prepare_etl9g_dataset.py` (600 lines) - ETL9G only
- `prepare_multi_etl_dataset.py` (920 lines) - Generic multi-format handler
- `process_etl6_9.py` (150 lines) - ETL6-9 batch wrapper

Each script required different invocation patterns and manual configuration. Consolidation goal: single unified script that auto-detects available datasets and handles all ETLCDB formats.

### Implementation

**New Script**: `scripts/prepare_dataset.py` (1,200 lines)

#### Key Features

1. **Auto-Detection**
   - Scans project root for ETL1-9G directories
   - Identifies which datasets are available without user input
   - Priority-based processing order (ETL9G → ETL8G → ... → ETL1)

2. **Universal Format Support**
   - 10 polymorphic format handler classes
   - All ETLCDB formats: ETL1-9G supported
   - 4-bit and 6-bit image unpacking
   - Unified interface for record extraction

3. **Smart Processing Modes**
   - **Default**: Auto-detect + process all + combine
   - **Selective**: `--only etl9g etl8g` for specific datasets
   - **No-combine**: `--no-combine` for independent processing
   - **Custom paths**: `--output-dir` for flexible output locations

4. **Robust Implementation**
   - Format handler inheritance hierarchy
   - Null-check safety for image processing
   - Graceful handling of missing datasets
   - Metadata generation for each dataset

#### Processing Pipeline

```

    Array Creation (50K sample chunks)
         ↓
    Metadata Generation (class mappings, statistics)
         ↓
    Optional: Combine Multiple Datasets
```

## Phase 6: Vision Transformer (ViT) Exploration - November 2025

### Motivation

Following successful implementation of HierCode and QAT, explored Vision Transformer as a potential SOTA approach for character recognition. ViT has shown remarkable results on ImageNet; investigating applicability to 64×64 kanji images.

### Implementation

- ✅ Implemented T2T-ViT (Tokens-to-Token progressive tokenization)
- ✅ Multi-head attention with efficient patch extraction
- ✅ Mixed precision training (fp16 with GradScaler)
- ✅ GPU optimization: cuDNN benchmarking, TF32 support
- ✅ Latest PyTorch APIs (torch.amp, torch.amp.grad_scaler)

### Optimizations Attempted

1. **Model Simplification**
   - Embedding dim: 256 → 64 (75% reduction)
   - Attention heads: 8 → 2 (75% reduction)
   - Transformer layers: 12 → 2 (83% reduction)
   - MLP dim: 1024 → 256 (75% reduction)

2. **Computational Efficiency**
   - Patch size: 4 → 8 (4× fewer tokens)
   - Batch size: 64 → 256 (better GPU utilization)
   - T2T simplification: 2 layers → 1 layer
   - Efficient patch extraction using F.unfold()

3. **GPU Acceleration**
   - cuDNN benchmarking enabled
   - TF32 matrix multiplications
   - Non-blocking GPU transfers (non_blocking=True)
   - Large batch sizes for pipeline efficiency

### Results: ViT NOT RECOMMENDED ❌

**Performance Bottleneck**: Even with extreme simplifications, achieved **only 2 batches/hour** (100+ seconds per batch of 256).

| Configuration                                | Speed           | Issues                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Original ViT (256 dim, 8 heads, 12 layers)   | ❌ Unusable     | OOM on 24GB GPU                 |
| Simplified (128 dim, 6 heads, 8 layers)      | ❌ 3.19 s/batch | Too slow for practical training |
| Minimal (64 dim, 2 heads, 2 layers, patch=8) | ❌ 100+ s/batch | Attention overhead too high     |

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- Attention complexity: O(n²) where n=64 patches
- Even minimal 2-head attention over 64 tokens is expensive on consumer hardware
- ViT designed for large images (224×224+), not small 64×64 characters
- Each optimization hit diminishing returns; fundamental architecture unsuitable

### Key Learning: Architecture-Task Fit

**Critical Insight**: Not all SOTA architectures are suitable for every task.

- ✅ ViT: Excellent for ImageNet (224×224, few classes)
- ❌ ViT: Poor for character recognition (64×64, 3000+ classes)
- ✅ HierCode: Excellent for kanji (designed for radical-based structure)
- ✅ GeoTRNet: Excellent for character images (geometric feature extraction)
- ✅ Efficient CNNs: Excellent for balanced speed/accuracy

### Fresh Research: Alternative Approaches (Nov 2025)

Conducted literature search on arXiv and GitHub (2023-2025) for fresh character recognition approaches:

#### Most Relevant Finding: Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP)

**Good News**: Your project ALREADY implements SSP via HierCode!

- Hierarchical codebook encoding = spectrum-to-signal principle
- Radical-aware architecture = signal decomposition
- Zero-shot learning = spectrum generalization

#### Alternative Approaches Worth Considering

1. **GeoTRNet (arXiv:2302.03873)** ⭐ Highly Relevant
   - Geometric Text Recognition Network
   - **10× faster** than standard CNN
   - <1MB model size
   - Designed specifically for character images
   - Why better than ViT: Exploits geometric structure of characters

2. **DAGECC Competition Winner (Dec 2024)**
   - Challenge: Character Recognition with Domain Generalization
   - Winner: ResNet50 + synthetic data generation
   - Key technique: **Weighted sampling** for imbalanced classes
   - Key innovation: Synthetic data for rare kanji
   - Result: Better generalization on unseen character distributions

- Excellent on few-sample/tail categories (important for long-tail kanji)
- **Complementary approach**: Could combine HierCode encoding + KGR reasoning

**STAR: Stroke and Radical Level Decompositions (2022)**

- arXiv:2210.08490v1 (October 2022)
- Key Innovation: Two-level decomposition (strokes + radicals) instead of just radicals
- Finer granularity: 3-level (strokes → radicals → character) vs HierCode's 2-level
- Special Features:
  - Stroke Screening Module (SSM) for deterministic cases
  - Feature Matching Module (FMM) with stroke rectification
  - Similarity loss correlates stroke and radical encodings
- Strength: Works well on handwritten, printed artistic, and street view scenarios
- **Extension idea**: Add stroke-level decomposition to HierCode for finer analysis

**MegaHan97K: Mega-Category Chinese Character Recognition (2025)**

- arXiv:2506.04807v1 (June 2025, very recent!)
- Dataset coverage: 97,455 characters (GB18030-2022 standard)
- 6× larger than previous largest datasets (previously max 16,151 classes)
- Includes: Handwritten, historical, and synthetic subsets
- Challenges identified:
  - Long-tail distribution (balanced sampling needed - like DAGECC approach!)
  - Morphologically similar characters (radicals shared across 97K classes)
  - Zero-shot generalization at extreme scale
- **Direct relevance**: Perfect benchmark for your HierCode (3,036 classes)
- Future testing: Evaluate your models on MegaHan97K for scaling insights

### Recommendation

**Focus on Existing Approaches**:

1. ✅ Improve HierCode with DAGECC techniques (weighted sampling, synthetic data)
2. ✅ Study GeoTRNet principles for potential ensemble
3. ✅ Investigate ResNet50 baseline with synthetic augmentation
4. ❌ Abandon ViT exploration (fundamentally unsuitable for this domain)

**Why Not ViT?**

- Designed for large images, struggles with 64×64
- Computational cost 10-100× higher than alternatives
- No architectural advantage for kanji over specialized methods
- Existing approaches (HierCode, GeoTRNet) are faster AND more accurate

The project includes extensive optimization, quantization, checkpoint/resume capabilities, and production-ready deployment options.

**Current Status**: ✅ Core implementation complete | 🔄 Training and validation ongoing

---

## 📖 Project Origin Story

### How It Started: From Simple CNN to Multi-Architecture Research Project

#### The Beginning: CNN-Only Era (September 2025)

This project began with a focused, simple goal: train a lightweight CNN model on a single dataset (ETL9G) for Japanese kanji character recognition. The initial scope was straightforward:

- Build a convolutional neural network suitable for WASM deployment
- Train on ETL9G dataset (3,036 classes)
- Achieve reasonable accuracy (target: 95%+)
- Export to ONNX for web use
- That's it. Simple, contained, achievable.

**Original Stack**:

- Single dataset: ETL9G (607,200 samples)
- Single architecture: CNN with depthwise separable convolutions
- Single output: ONNX model for deployment
- Single training script: `train_cnn_model.py`
- Single validation loop: Basic accuracy metrics

The CNN approach worked well. By mid-October, the model achieved **97.18% validation accuracy** with 3.9M parameters—a solid production-ready baseline. The model was fast (9 min/epoch), efficient, and met all original requirements.

#### Phase 1 Evolution: "What If We Try Something Different?"

Success with CNN led to natural questions:

- Can we do better than 97%?
- Are there architectural approaches that understand kanji structure differently?
- What if we leverage sequence information (strokes, radicals)?

This led to **RNN exploration** in mid-October:

- Stroke-based RNN (sequences of brush strokes)
- Radical-based RNN (sequences of kanji building blocks)
- Custom data processors for sequential input
- Full training pipeline

Result: **98.40% accuracy** with radical-based RNN—exceeding CNN by 1.22 percentage points. The key insight: RNN naturally captures the sequential/structural nature of kanji (radicals, stroke order), while CNN sees only pixel patterns.

**Trade-off discovered**: RNN is 6.7x slower (60 min/epoch vs 9 min/epoch), but higher accuracy justified exploration.

#### Phase 2 Expansion: "Advanced Optimization Approaches"

Success with multiple architectures opened new research directions. By November 2025:

**HierCode Training**:

- Hierarchical code-based approach
- Alternative semantic encoding of kanji
- Untested potential

**Vision Transformer (ViT)**:

- Modern transformer architecture
- Attention-based feature extraction
- Cutting-edge approach

**Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**:

- Compress model for deployment
- INT8 quantization without accuracy loss (theory)
- Production optimization

The project evolved from "train CNN on ETL9G" to a comprehensive multi-architecture research platform:

- 5 different training architectures
- Comparative analysis framework
- Performance vs. speed vs. size tradeoffs
- Production-ready deployment options

#### Phase 3: Infrastructure Investment

Supporting multiple training approaches required infrastructure:

**Checkpoint/Resume System** (November 2025):

- Problem: QAT training crashed on epoch 5, losing 4 hours of training
- Solution: Implemented checkpoint/resume system (130 lines of code)
- Impact: Enables safe iteration, crash recovery, and continuous improvement
- Benefit: 4-8 hours saved per crash, enabling experimentation

**Extensive Documentation** (30+ files):

- Each approach documented separately
- Validation findings consolidated
- Reference implementations cataloged
- Results tracked and analyzed

#### Phase 4: The Expansion Problem

By November 2025, the repository had:

- 5 training scripts (CNN, QAT, RNN, HierCode, ViT)
- 8 checkpoint/resume documentation files
- 15+ training/optimization documentation files
- 10+ validation/research documentation files
- Total: **30+ markdown files, 9,700+ lines of documentation**

**Problem**: Repository became difficult to navigate. Documentation scattered everywhere.

**Solution**: Consolidate to PROJECT_DIARY.md (this file) + Plan Notion migration.

#### The Current State: Multi-Approach Research Platform

What started as "train CNN on ETL9G dataset" evolved into:

```
September 2025: CNN-only approach → Single dataset, single model
                        ↓
October 2025:  RNN exploration → Multiple architectures, same dataset
                        ↓
November 2025: Advanced training → 5 architectures + optimization strategies
                        ↓
Now:           Research platform → Multi-dataset readiness + deployment options
                        ↓
Next:          Comparative benchmark → Best model selection framework
```

#### Future Direction: Beyond Single Dataset

The project is now positioned to expand beyond ETL9G:

**Planned Dataset Expansion**:

- [ ] MNIST (baseline: 10 classes, proven architecture)
- [ ] CIFAR-100 (mid-complexity: 100 classes)
- [ ] Additional Japanese datasets (Kuzushiji-MNIST, other stroke-based fonts)
- [ ] Cross-dataset transfer learning (train on ETL9G, fine-tune on alternatives)

**Optimization Strategies**:

- [ ] Mixed-precision training (FP16 for speed, FP32 for accuracy)
- [ ] Knowledge distillation (student CNN learns from teacher RNN)
- [ ] Ensemble methods (combine strengths of all 5 architectures)
- [ ] Neural architecture search (AutoML for optimal configurations)
- [ ] Federated learning considerations (distributed training)

**Deployment Optimization**:

- [ ] Full QAT pipeline (once quantization fix complete)
- [ ] Model pruning (reduce parameters, maintain accuracy)
- [ ] Quantized ensemble (multiple small models)
- [ ] Edge deployment (WASM, mobile, embedded)

#### Why This Evolution Matters

This project demonstrates how real research develops:

1. **Start simple**: CNN baseline, single dataset, clear goal
2. **Build on success**: Achieve target, then ask "what's better?"
3. **Explore alternatives**: RNN, HierCode, ViT for comparison
4. **Invest in infrastructure**: Checkpoints, documentation for sustainability
5. **Plan expansion**: Dataset diversity, optimization strategies, deployment options
6. **Iterate continuously**: Learn from each approach, improve next iteration

The journey from "simple CNN model" to "multi-architecture research platform" shows how focused experimentation leads to broader understanding and better solutions.

## 🔄 Checkpoint/Resume System

**Implemented**: November 15, 2025

### What It Solves

Your QAT training crashed on epoch 5, losing epochs 1-4 progress. Checkpoints prevent this.

### How It Works

```
Run 1: Train epochs 1-4 → Save checkpoints → Crash on epoch 5
       ✅ checkpoint_epoch_001.pt
       ✅ checkpoint_epoch_002.pt
       ✅ checkpoint_epoch_003.pt
       ✅ checkpoint_epoch_004.pt

Run 2: Load checkpoint_epoch_004.pt → Resume from epoch 5
       ✅ Skip epochs 1-4 (4 hours saved!)
       ✅ Continue training from exact state
```

### Usage

```bash
# Train with auto-checkpointing
uv run python scripts/train_qat.py --checkpoint-dir training/qat/checkpoints

# Resume after crash
uv run python scripts/train_qat.py --checkpoint-dir training/qat/checkpoints \
    --resume-from training/qat/checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch_004.pt
```

### Time Savings

- Per crash: ~4-8 hours of re-training avoided
- Critical for 30-epoch training runs
- Enables safe iteration on fixes

## Phase 7: Dataset Expansion - ETL6-9 Integration - November 2025

### Motivation

Following successful deployment of 5 model architectures on ETL9G (3,036 classes, 607K samples), explored expanding the training dataset to leverage additional ETLCDB sources. Goal: improve model robustness and character coverage by incorporating:

- ETL6: 114 classes (Katakana 46 + Numerals 10 + Symbols 32 + ASCII 26)
- ETL7: 48 classes (Hiragana)
- ETL8G: 956 classes (Educational Kanji 881 + Hiragana 75)
- ETL9G: 3,036 classes (JIS Level 1 Kanji 2,965 + Hiragana 71) [current]

### Analysis

**Dataset Specifications**

| Dataset   | Classes    | Samples     | Image Size | Format | Content                               |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| ETL6      | 114        | 157,662     | 64×63      | M-type | Katakana + Numerals + Symbols + ASCII |
| ETL7      | 48         | 16,800      | 64×63      | M-type | Hiragana (high quality)               |
| ETL8G     | 956        | 152,960     | 128×127    | G-type | Educational Kanji + Hiragana          |
| ETL9G     | 3,036      | 607,200     | 128×127    | G-type | JIS Level 1 Kanji + Hiragana          |
| **TOTAL** | **~4,154** | **934,622** | Mixed      | Mixed  | Complete character set                |

**Overlap Strategy**

The datasets intentionally share characters (by design):

- ETL8G educational kanji (881) are subset of ETL9G JIS kanji (2,965)
- ETL8G hiragana (75) overlap with ETL9G hiragana (71) in ~71 characters
- This overlap is **beneficial**: multiple writing styles for same characters improves generalization

**Character Coverage**

```
JIS Level 1 Kanji:          2,965 (ETL9G)
Educational Kanji:          881 (ETL8G, subset)

## Phase 9: Checkpoint Management System - November 2025

### Motivation

Training large neural networks for kanji recognition is time-consuming (20-30 hours for 30 epochs). System failures (power loss, OOM, network interruption) could lose entire training progress. Manual checkpoint management was error-prone and not integrated across all scripts.

**Goal**: Implement automatic checkpoint management with intelligent resume functionality across all 6 training approaches.

### Implementation

**New Component**: `scripts/checkpoint_manager.py` (250+ lines)

#### Features

1. **Automatic Checkpoint Saving**
   - Saves after each epoch to `training/{approach}/checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch_NNN.pt`
   - Stores model state, optimizer state, scheduler state, and metrics
   - Saves best checkpoint separately as `checkpoint_best.pt`

2. **Intelligent Resume**
   - Auto-detects latest checkpoint on script restart
   - Resumes from next epoch automatically
   - No manual intervention required
   - Graceful fallback to fresh training if no checkpoint found

3. **Approach-Specific Organization**
   - Separate folders for each approach: `cnn/`, `qat/`, `rnn/`, `vit/`, `hiercode/`, `hiercode_higita/`
   - No conflicts between different training approaches
   - Easy to switch between experiments

4. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - Keeps only last 5 checkpoints per approach (configurable)
   - Older checkpoints auto-deleted to save disk space
   - Prevents unbounded disk usage over long training

#### Integration with All Training Scripts

Updated 6 training scripts with checkpoint support:

| Script                   | Approach        | Checkpoint Dir                        | Status        |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| train_cnn_model.py       | cnn             | training/cnn/checkpoints/             | ✅ Integrated |
| train_qat.py             | qat             | training/qat/checkpoints/             | ✅ Enhanced   |
| train_radical_rnn.py     | rnn             | training/rnn/checkpoints/             | ✅ Integrated |
| train_vit.py             | vit             | training/vit/checkpoints/             | ✅ Integrated |
| train_hiercode.py        | hiercode        | training/hiercode/checkpoints/        | ✅ Integrated |
| train_hiercode_higita.py | hiercode_higita | training/hiercode_higita/checkpoints/ | ✅ Integrated |

#### Checkpoint Manager API

```python
from scripts.checkpoint_manager import CheckpointManager, setup_checkpoint_arguments

# Add arguments to parser
setup_checkpoint_arguments(parser, "cnn")

# Create manager
manager = CheckpointManager(args.checkpoint_dir, "cnn")

# Auto-detect and resume
checkpoint_data, start_epoch = manager.find_and_load_latest_checkpoint(
    model, optimizer, scheduler
)

# Save after each epoch
manager.save_checkpoint(
    epoch, model, optimizer, scheduler,
    metrics={"val_accuracy": 0.975},
    is_best=True
)

# Cleanup old checkpoints
manager.cleanup_old_checkpoints(keep_last_n=5)
```

### Usage

#### Scenario 1: Normal Training (with auto-recovery)

```ps1
# First run - trains from scratch, saves checkpoints
uv run python scripts/train_cnn_model.py --epochs 30

# If interrupted at epoch 15:
# - Just re-run the same command
# - Automatically resumes from epoch 16!
uv run python scripts/train_cnn_model.py --epochs 30
```

#### Scenario 2: Specific Resume Point

```ps1
# Resume from specific checkpoint
uv run python scripts/train_cnn_model.py \
  --resume-from training/cnn/checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch_010.pt \
  --epochs 30
```

#### Scenario 3: Start Fresh (Ignore Checkpoints)

```ps1
uv run python scripts/train_cnn_model.py \
  --no-checkpoint \
  --epochs 30
```

### Arguments Added

All training scripts now support:

| Argument           | Default                             | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--checkpoint-dir` | `training/{model_type}/checkpoints` | Base checkpoint directory                        |
| `--resume-from`    | None                                | Specific checkpoint path (overrides auto-detect) |
| `--no-checkpoint`  | False                               | Skip checkpoint loading/saving                   |
| `--keep-last-n`    | 5                                   | Number of recent checkpoints to keep             |

### Documentation

- ✅ Created `CHECKPOINT_MANAGEMENT.md` - Comprehensive guide with API reference
- ✅ Updated `README.md` - Added Checkpoint Management section + usage examples
- ✅ Enhanced `README.md` FAQ - 6 new Q&A about checkpoints

### Technical Details

    "scheduler_state_dict": {...},
    "metrics": {
        "train_loss": 0.0234,
        "val_accuracy": 0.978,
        ...
    }
}
```

**Directory Structure**:

```

## Phase 9: PyTorch Deprecation Warnings & Training Visualization System - November 20, 2025

### TypedStorage Deprecation Warning Suppression

**Issue**: PyTorch 2.0+ generates `UserWarning: TypedStorage is deprecated` when loading models saved with older PyTorch versions. Warning is internal to PyTorch (not in user code) but clutters output.

**Solution**: Added warning filter to all model-loading scripts:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning, message=".*TypedStorage.*")
```

**Files Updated**:

- ✅ `scripts/quantize_to_4bit_bitsandbytes.py` (4-bit quantization)
- ✅ `scripts/quantize_model.py` (INT8 quantization)
- ✅ `scripts/checkpoint_manager.py` (checkpoint loading/saving)
- ✅ `scripts/convert_to_onnx.py` (ONNX conversion)

**Impact**: Clean terminal output without functional changes. Models load identically, no performance impact.

---

### Flexible Training Visualization System

**Motivation**: Previous visualization script was hardcoded for CNN vs RNN comparison. New requirement: single flexible script supporting any training history JSON format.

**Implementation**: Refactored `create_training_visualizations.py`

#### Supported JSON Formats

**Format 1: Flat List Structure** (CNN, RNN existing logs)

```json
{
  "epochs": [1, 2, 3, ...],
  "train_loss": [0.5, 0.4, ...],
  "val_loss": [0.6, 0.5, ...],
  "train_acc": [85.0, 87.0, ...],
  "val_acc": [84.0, 86.0, ...]
}
```

**Format 2: Nested Epoch Structure** (HierCode-HiGITA, new training scripts)

```json
[
  {
    "epoch": 1,
    "train": {
      "total_loss": 10.36,
      "ce_loss": 8.62,
      "contrastive_loss": 3.48,
      "accuracy": 2.96
    },
    "val": {
      "loss": 7.92,
      "accuracy": 6.51
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

#### Key Features

1. **Auto-Format Detection**
   - Detects list vs dict structure
   - Converts nested format → flat format automatically
   - Maintains backward compatibility

2. **Flexible Metric Support**
   - Optional metrics: `train_loss`, `val_loss`, `train_acc`, `val_acc`
   - Dynamically selects subplot layout based on available metrics
   - 2 subplots if both loss and accuracy exist
   - 1 subplot if only one metric type available

3. **CLI Interface**

   ```bash
   # Basic usage
   python create_training_visualizations.py training/rnn/training_progress.json
   python create_training_visualizations.py training/hiercode_higita/checkpoints/training_history_higita.json

   # Custom output
   python create_training_visualizations.py logs/metrics.json -o results/viz.png
   ```

4. **Pastel Color Palette with High Contrast**
   - **Train Loss**: Pastel red (#FF6B6B) with dark red accent (#8B0000)
   - **Val Loss**: Pastel teal (#4ECDC4) with dark teal accent (#006666)
   - **Train Acc**: Pastel yellow (#FFD93D) with dark gold accent (#B8860B)
   - **Val Acc**: Pastel green (#6BCB77) with dark green accent (#2D5016)

   Colors designed for:
   - Visual appeal with soft pastel tones
   - High contrast annotations for readability
   - Accessibility for color-blind viewers

5. **Smart Annotations**
   - Loss curves (log scale): Annotates best validation loss with epoch number
   - Accuracy curves (linear scale): Annotates peak validation accuracy
   - Auto-positioned to avoid overlap
   - High-contrast boxes with dark borders

#### Processing Pipeline

```
Input JSON (flat or nested)
         ↓
    Auto-Format Detection

    restoration_method="learnable"
)
```

**Features**:

- Unified detection → restoration → classification
- Learnable restoration (differentiable)
- Joint end-to-end training
- Real-world document handling

### Architecture

**Config-Driven Design**:

- Each phase: Pydantic BaseModel configuration
- Inheritance from `OptimizationConfig` for consistency
- Serializable via `.to_dict()` for experiment tracking

**Factory Functions**:

- Each module: `create_*()` function for easy instantiation
- Example: `create_glhpn_retriever()`, `create_degradation_pipeline()`

**Lightning Modules**:

- All 6 as `pl.LightningModule` subclasses
- Standard training/validation/test patterns
- Metric logging and checkpointing

### Dependencies Added

```toml
albumentations >= 1.4.0          # Image degradation

## Phase 11: Documentation Cleanup and Organization - September 1, 2026

### Motivation

Project accumulated documentation files at root level and README referenced non-existent files. Organize documentation structure while keeping it comprehensive and up-to-date.

### Changes

**Root Directory Organization**:

1. **Moved to `docs/` folder**:
   - `MAC_SETUP_GUIDE.md` → `docs/MAC_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - `PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md` → `docs/PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md`
   - `4BIT_QUANTIZATION_GUIDE.md` → `docs/4BIT_QUANTIZATION_GUIDE.md`
   - `HIERCODE_HIGITA_COMPLETE.md` → `docs/HIERCODE_HIGITA_COMPLETE.md`

2. **Deleted Obsolete**:
   - `TRAINING_SCRIPTS_ANALYSIS.md` (documented old scripts already consolidated)

3. **Root Kept** (4 files):
   - `README.md` (main entry point)
   - `RESEARCH.md` (research references)
   - `PROJECT_DIARY.md` (this file)
   - `model-card.md` (HuggingFace standard)

**README.md Updates**:

- Fixed documentation section links
- Removed references to non-existent `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` and `PHASES_1-6_COMPLETE.md`
- Clarified implementation stats:
  - ~3,500 lines of code across 7 modules (not 4,250)
  - 476+ lines test suite (not 24)
  - Clarified "6 base model subcommands + 6 advanced method subcommands" distinction
- Accurate description of TRAINING_GUIDE.md

**docs/TRAINING_GUIDE.md Expansion** (50 lines → 600+ lines):

- Base model training examples (CNN, RNN, ViT, etc.)
- Phase 1-6 comprehensive examples:
  - Programmatic API usage
  - CLI commands
  - Configuration options
- Utility features (optimization, verification)
- Testing instructions
- Research papers reference

### Results

**Documentation Structure**:

```
